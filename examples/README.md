Qsubsec Template Examples
=========================

This folder contains several example templates as well as a brief description of each. Mostly these are not "real" biological problems, as the aim is not to provide workflows, but to show how to write templates.

hello-world
-------------

This is a very simple example that shows how basic templates work.

multiple-inputs
-----------------

This shows how to use iterated tokens to run the same template with multiple inputs from the command line or read from a file.

flow-control
--------------

This set of templates shows how template sections can be used together to create pipelines, including the use of flags to test for successful completion of jobs.
